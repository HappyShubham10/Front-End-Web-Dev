## Lecture 1:
- Getting confidence in software development is very important

- Doing project will only gives you the confidence

- Confidence will only clear up the interviews

- No extra tool required to setup to learn 
  javascript

## Lecture 2: Setting up local environment

- Javascript execution is same for browser or running on any environment

- Every source code has meaning in javascript, like console.log() has some meaning in javascript, it is syntax in programming language

- Every programming language comes with some extenstion like .js, .py

- Every software has capability to understand the syntax whether it is .js or .py, which we call interpretor or compiler

- The compiler / interpretor was hidden in browser but now taken out in nodejs enviroment

- Now we no need to write, index.html and create the seaprate js file and add in script, as it was attached with broweser.

- Now we can run javascript directly with node environment, Hence Javascript is used everywhere like in frontend, backend etc

- Install the nodejs from nodejs.org and run in the local machine

- For writing the code use, VS Code, as it very popular now a days, it is from microsoft

- VS Code will help in color correction, indentation etc

- Go to view ➜ terminal, here you can see the terminal

- Check whether node is installed or not: node -v, our work done, if we get some number like 18, then we are ok

- To execute the code, we use: node filename

## Lecture 3: Github

- We have lot of online code execution environment available like Github.

- Lets see, how can we setup the code environment in Github,

  - Go to Github and create the account
  - Create new repository ➜ code-with-javascript-one

  - Create the **README.md** and create the repository

## Lecture 4: Variables & Constants

![Var](/06.%20JavaScript/images/variables.jpg)

- Only people will survive in the Tech indutry whos motive is to create something product

- Through javascript, we can create, mobile app, web app etc

- Set goal to create Ecommerce app or social media app

- All game is about mindset, here mideset to create a sample product

- Think to create a ecomerce app

- I need to attract user and make him into register

- Given him/her unique id

- When user comes ➜ he enter the details like name, city, etc, it needs to store ➜ it stored in memory space, here it is varaible later DB 

- Here, all the game is about, storing the data and retriving it

- So we learn variable and constants

- variable can be change but constant is constant

- We will learn about investigation

- We should the name that is easily readable

- When we see the var, let, const, it means, we need to assign in memory

- Const means, we cant change the value, it will through an error, if we try to change the constant value

- To write a comment, we use // 2 slashes, it means, javascript cant execute this lines

- We can print multiple values in console.log([]) like this by separting commas

- In js, let and const and be done using let and const

- In js, there was a problem of scope, means anything written in {}

- In js, when some programmer change the value in scope, it will impact the existing varaible

- So in modern js, we use let, const to overcome the issue of block scope and function scope

- /* */ this is also way of comment

- We can reserve the variable without using anykeyword as well, but it is not good practice

- In js, semicolon is optional

- Defualt value of let is undefined
